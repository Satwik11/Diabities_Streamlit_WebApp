# Diabities_Streamlit_WebApp

In this project, our objective is to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on various features like Glucose level, Insulin, Age, BMI. We will perform all the steps from Data gathering to Model deployment. During Model evaluation, we compare various machine learning algorithms on the basis of accuracy_score metric and find the best one. Then we create a web app using streamlit

The project predicts whether a patient is diabetic or not using Random Forest Classifier which builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable result.
